# When does differential misclassification matter?

When does differential outcome misclassification matter for estimating prevalence?

When accounting for misclassification, investigators make assumptions about whether misclassification is “differential” or “nondifferential.” Most guidance on differential misclassification considers settings where outcome misclassification varies across levels of exposure, or vice versa. Here, we examine when covariate-differential misclassification must be considered when estimating overall outcome prevalence. The provided code walks though simulations designed to answer this question and illustrates results with an applied example.
